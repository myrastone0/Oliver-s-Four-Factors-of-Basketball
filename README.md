# What impact do Oliver's Four Factors have on a basketball team's success?

In an attempt to determine the most important attributes needed for a basketball team to win games, Dean Oliver identified what he called the "Four Factors of Basketball Success." In order of importance (or relative weight), those factors are:

- Shooting (40%)
- Turnovers (25%)
- Rebounding (20%)
- Free Throws (15%)


## Our Goal

We wish to determine if the relative importance of each factor (eFG%, TO%, OREB%, and FTR) actually follows Oliver's breakdown of 40/25/20/15.

Using the 2016-2017 NBA Team Box Stats obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pablote/nba-enhanced-stats), let's see if the data follows Oliver's breakdown to predict the number of wins a team amasses during the regular season.

We'll use a Random Forest and Linear Regression to model the data.
